/*
    In TypeScript, a tuple is a data structure that allows you to store a fixed-size collection of elements of different types. Unlike arrays, where all elements are typically of the same type, a tuple lets you specify a specific type for each element at a specific index. Tuples are useful when you want to represent a structured set of values where the position of each value is significant.
